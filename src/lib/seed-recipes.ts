    title: 'Hazy Juicy IPA',
    description: 'A tropical, hazy New England-style IPA bursting with citrus and stone fruit. Pillowy soft mouthfeel with low bitterness — the kind of beer that makes you wonder why you ever bought six-packs.',
    ingredients: [
      '10 lbs 2-row pale malt',
      '2 lbs flaked oats',
      '1 lb flaked wheat',
      '0.5 lb honey malt',
      '1 oz Citra hops (60 min)',
      '2 oz Mosaic hops (whirlpool)',
      '2 oz Galaxy hops (whirlpool)',
      '2 oz Citra hops (dry hop, day 3)',
      '2 oz Mosaic hops (dry hop, day 3)',
      '1 packet London Ale III yeast (WLP013)',
      '1 tsp Irish moss (15 min)',
      '0.5 tsp yeast nutrient (10 min)',
    ],
    instructions: [
      'Heat 4.5 gallons of water to 164°F for mash-in.',
      'Mash all grains at 152°F for 60 minutes. Stir every 15 minutes.',
      'Sparge with 3.5 gallons of 170°F water to collect ~6.5 gallons of wort.',
      'Bring to a rolling boil. Add Citra bittering hops at 60 minutes.',
      'Add Irish moss at 15 minutes, yeast nutrient at 10 minutes.',
      'At flameout, add whirlpool hops (Mosaic + Galaxy). Steep for 20 minutes at 170°F.',
      'Cool wort to 66°F as quickly as possible. Transfer to fermenter.',
      'Pitch London Ale III yeast. Ferment at 66-68°F for 14 days.',
      'Dry hop on day 3 with Citra and Mosaic — just toss them in, no bag needed.',
      'Cold crash at 34°F for 48 hours. Package with minimal oxygen exposure.',
      'Carbonate to 2.4 volumes CO₂. Drink fresh — this beer doesn\'t age, it peaks at 2 weeks.',
    ],
    tags: ['homebrew', 'beer', 'IPA', 'drink'],
    notes: 'The key to a great hazy is London Ale III — it drops bright but keeps the beer soft. Don\'t over-bitter. The hops do the talking in the whirlpool and dry hop. Water chemistry: bump chloride to 150ppm, sulfate around 100ppm.',

    title: 'Cacio e Pepe',
    description: 'The Roman classic in its purest form — just pasta, pecorino, and black pepper. Deceptively simple, impossibly satisfying. The trick is the starchy pasta water.',
    ingredients: [
      '1 lb tonnarelli or spaghetti',
      '2 cups finely grated Pecorino Romano',
      '2 tbsp freshly cracked black pepper (coarse)',
      'Kosher salt for pasta water',
    ],
    instructions: [
      'Bring a pot of well-salted water to boil. Use less water than usual — you want it starchy. A tall narrow pot is ideal.',
      'Toast the cracked black pepper in a large dry skillet over medium heat for 1-2 minutes until fragrant. Add 1 cup of pasta water and let it simmer.',
      'Cook pasta 1 minute shy of al dente. Reserve 2 cups of starchy pasta water before draining.',
      'While pasta cooks, combine Pecorino in a bowl with ½ cup of warm (not hot!) pasta water. Stir into a thick paste — this is your emulsion base.',
      'Transfer pasta directly to the pepper skillet with tongs. Add ½ cup more pasta water.',
      'Remove from heat. Add the Pecorino paste in three additions, tossing vigorously each time. The motion creates the creamy sauce.',
      'Add splashes of pasta water as needed — you want glossy, coating-the-back-of-a-spoon consistency.',
      'Serve immediately on warm plates. Top with more Pecorino and a crack of pepper.',
    ],
    tags: ['pasta', 'Italian', 'dinner', 'quick', 'vegetarian'],
    notes: 'The #1 mistake: adding cheese to a hot pan and getting clumps. Work off heat, add cheese gradually, toss constantly. Real Pecorino Romano only — Parmesan is a different dish. If you can find tonnarelli, use it — the square-cut shape holds the sauce perfectly.',

    title: 'Spicy Mango Margarita',
    description: 'A Palm Springs poolside essential. Sweet Champagne mango meets smoky jalapeño heat with a Tajín rim. Dangerously crushable on a 110° day.',
    ingredients: [
      '2 oz blanco tequila (Fortaleza or Pasote)',
      '1 oz fresh lime juice',
      '0.75 oz agave nectar',
      '½ ripe Champagne mango, cubed',
      '2–3 slices fresh jalapeño',
      'Tajín seasoning for rim',
      'Lime wedge for rim',
      'Ice',
    ],
    instructions: [
      'Muddle mango cubes and jalapeño slices in a shaker. Press firmly to extract all the mango juice — you want it pulpy.',
      'Add tequila, lime juice, and agave nectar. Fill shaker with ice.',
      'Shake vigorously for 15 seconds — longer than you think.',
      'Run a lime wedge around the rim of a rocks glass. Dip in Tajín to coat.',
      'Fill glass with fresh ice. Double-strain the margarita over it through a fine mesh strainer.',
      'Garnish with a mango slice and a jalapeño round floating on top.',
    ],
    tags: ['cocktail', 'drink', 'spicy', 'summer', 'Mexican'],
    notes: 'Use Champagne mangos (the small yellow ones) — they\'re sweeter and silkier than Tommy Atkins. For less heat, remove jalapeño seeds. For more heat, let the jalapeño sit in the tequila for 10 minutes before shaking. This is Meghan\'s go-to when we have people over.',

    title: 'Honey Walnut Shrimp',
    description: 'Crispy, creamy, sweet — the Chinese-American takeout classic that\'s actually worth making at home. Candied walnuts, tempura-battered shrimp, and that iconic condensed milk sauce.',
    ingredients: [
      '1 lb large shrimp, peeled and deveined',
      '1 cup walnuts',
      '½ cup sugar (for candying walnuts)',
      '¼ cup water (for candying walnuts)',
      '¾ cup cornstarch',
      '2 egg whites',
      '¼ cup mayonnaise (Kewpie preferred)',
      '2 tbsp sweetened condensed milk',
      '1 tbsp honey',
      '1 tbsp fresh lemon juice',
      'Vegetable oil for frying',
      'Pinch of salt',
    ],
    instructions: [
      'Candy the walnuts: combine sugar and ¼ cup water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, add walnuts, simmer 5 minutes. Remove and spread on parchment paper to cool. They\'ll harden as they dry.',
      'Make the sauce: whisk together Kewpie mayo, condensed milk, honey, and lemon juice. Set aside — it should be smooth and pourable.',
      'Prep the shrimp: pat completely dry. Whisk egg whites until slightly frothy. Toss shrimp in egg whites, then dredge in cornstarch, shaking off excess.',
      'Heat 2 inches of oil to 350°F in a heavy pot or wok. Fry shrimp in batches for 2-3 minutes until golden and crispy. Drain on a wire rack.',
      'In a large bowl, toss the hot crispy shrimp with the sauce until evenly coated.',
      'Plate on a bed of shredded lettuce. Scatter candied walnuts on top.',
      'Serve immediately — the shrimp lose their crunch fast.',
    ],
    tags: ['Chinese', 'seafood', 'dinner', 'crispy', 'crowd-pleaser'],
    notes: 'Kewpie mayo makes a real difference here — it\'s richer and tangier than regular mayo. Candy the walnuts ahead of time (they keep for days in an airtight container). Dale will absolutely beg for this one — don\'t give in, the walnuts aren\'t great for dogs.',
